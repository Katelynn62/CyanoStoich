Code and data analysis for the cyanobacteria bloom stoichiometry manuscript.

This is the code I've written for a manuscript investigating the relationships between nutrient stoichiometry (resource and seston) and cyanobacteria bloom dynamics (bloom initiation, intensity, and duration), and cyanotoxin abundance. 

Upon journal acceptance, data will be uploaded.
